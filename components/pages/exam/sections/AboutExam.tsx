				The Certified Hospice and Palliative Nurse (CHPNÂ®) exam is a specialized
				certification for registered nurses dedicated to providing care for
				patients facing terminal illnesses. Earning this credential validates a
				nurse's expertise in end-of-life care, encompassing complex symptom
				management, emotional support, and the nuances of holistic patient and
				family care during advanced stages of illness. This certification not
				only reflects a high standard of competency in hospice and palliative
				nursing but also recognizes a commitment to upholding quality of life
				and dignity for patients at the end of life.
